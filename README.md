ðŸŒ± Embrace the Power of Cucumber Framework! ðŸŒ±
Are you tired of manual testing? Are you looking for an efficient way to streamline your software testing process? Look no further than the Cucumber Framework! 

Here's a quick overview of what I've learned and included in my notes:

 What is Cucumber?
Cucumber is a powerful open-source testing tool that enables Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) by allowing collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders. With its easy-to-understand language, Cucumber bridges the gap between technical and non-technical team members, making it a go-to choice for Agile teams worldwide.
 	
  
  Key Benefits of Cucumber:
ïƒ˜	Readable and Understandable: Cucumber's Gherkin syntax makes test scenarios easy to read and comprehend, enhancing collaboration and ensuring clarity across the team.
ïƒ˜	Cross-functional Collaboration: Cucumber encourages collaboration among developers, testers, and product owners, promoting a shared understanding of the application's behavior.
ïƒ˜	Reusable Step Definitions: Save time and effort with Cucumber's reusable step definitions, reducing duplications and improving maintenance.
ïƒ˜	Test Automation: Integrate Cucumber with automation frameworks like Selenium and Appium to create robust, automated test suites, ensuring faster feedback and increased productivity.
ïƒ˜	Improved Test Coverage: Cucumber ensures comprehensive test coverage, leaving no stone unturned when it comes to validating your application's functionality.

Test Driven Development (TDD)
TDD is an iterative development process. Each iteration starts with a set of tests written for a new piece of functionality.

 Data Driven Testing in Cucumber
	ïƒ˜	Parameterizing without Example Keyword.
	ïƒ˜	Parameterization with Example Keyword.
	ïƒ˜	Parameterization using Tables.
	ïƒ˜	Parameterization using Excel Files.

Cucumber Reports
Whenever we do test execution, it is also required to understand the output of the execution. Whether it is Manual execution or an Automated, the output of the same must be in format, which immediately depicts the overall results of the execution. 
Hence, our framework also should have the same capability to create output or generate test execution reports.
 
RestAPI test using Cucumber:- 
	A REST API is a way to communicate for two computer systems over HTTP, which is similar to web browsers and servers.
REST API testing is testing API using 4 major methods.
1.	POST, 
2.	GET,
3.	PUT and 
4.	DELETE.
